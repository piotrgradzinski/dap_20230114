"""
Write a program that calculates the cost of travel from city A to city B
based on the number of kilometers given by the user, the price of fuel
and fuel consumption. Ask the user for the cities names, distance, fueal price
and fuel consumption.

Use a proportion formula to calculate this:
cost = distance * fuel_consumption / 100.0 * price

Sample program input:
City A: Warsaw
City B: Gdańsk
Distance Warsaw-Gdansk: 420
Fuel price: 4.55
Fuel consumption per 100 km: 5.5
Sample program output:
The cost of the Warsaw-Gdańsk journey is 105 PLN
