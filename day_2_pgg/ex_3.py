Write a program that calculates the average temperature
for a given week based on temperatures entered by the user.

average = sum of temperatures / 7

before while loop:
    define 2 variables:
        - storing current day number, for which we are getting data, start with 1
        - temperature sum variable, start with 0
while:
    condition: day number should less than or equal to 7
    body of the while loop:
        - get the temp from the user and convert to int and add (+=) to temperature sum variable
        - increase the day number by one

after while loop:
    - calculate average: sum of temperature sum variable / 7
    - print the result
